# Bullshit Detection

Identify and call out pretension, inauthenticity, and empty sophistication in any domain—distinguishing genuine quality from performance.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating a restaurant, product, experience, or service
- Assessing whether someone or something is authentic
- Cutting through marketing speak and PR
- Deciding whether something is worth your time and money
- Identifying imposters in any field
- User asks "Is this authentic or pretentious?" or "Cut through the bullshit" or "What's really going on here?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | What you're evaluating (restaurant, product, person, experience, organization) |
| claims | No | What the subject claims about itself |
| observations | No | What you've actually observed |
| context | No | Relevant background (price, reputation, etc.) |

## Bourdain's Authenticity Framework

Anthony Bourdain spent his career calling out pretension while celebrating genuine quality. His framework distinguishes real craft from performance.

### The Core Principle

**Authentic:** Doing something well because you care about doing it well.
**Pretentious:** Performing quality for status, recognition, or price justification.

The pretentious meal costs $400 and leaves you hungry for meaning.
The authentic meal costs $4 and tells you something true about a place and its people.

### Authenticity Indicators

| Marker | Authentic | Pretentious |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Focus** | The craft itself | How the craft is perceived |
| **Pride source** | Quality of the work | Recognition for the work |
| **Who's it for** | The people doing it | The people watching |
| **Language** | Simple, specific | Jargon-heavy, vague |
| **History** | Earned through time | Constructed for marketing |
| **Imperfections** | Present and honest | Hidden or denied |
| **Consistency** | Does this well, always | Changes with trends |
| **Who does the work** | Same people, always | Invisible, interchangeable |

### The Five Tests

**1. The Hands Test**
Who made this? Can you see them? Are they credited? Are they paid fairly?

*Authentic:* The grandmother who's made this dish for fifty years. The craftsperson whose name is on the work. The team that's been together for decades.

*Pretentious:* "Our artisans" (unnamed). "Curated by" (did what exactly?). A rotating cast of underpaid labor behind a famous name.

**2. The Why Test**
Why does this exist? What problem does it solve? Who asked for this?

*Authentic:* Exists because someone cared about making it good. Solves a real problem. Serves actual people.

*Pretentious:* Exists to be impressive. Solves a problem no one has. Serves the ego of its creator.

**3. The Simplicity Test**
Can they explain what they do without jargon? Does the complexity add value or obscure emptiness?

*Authentic:* Clear explanation of what they do and why. Complexity exists for a reason.

*Pretentious:* Word salad. Complexity for its own sake. "Elevated" and "reimagined" without substance.

**4. The Consistency Test**
Do they do this well when no one important is watching? Would they do this if it weren't cool/profitable?

*Authentic:* Same quality every time. Would do this even if it weren't trendy. Been doing this before it was fashionable.

*Pretentious:* Different quality for different audiences. Chasing trends. Recently pivoted to whatever's hot.

**5. The Humility Test**
Can they admit what they don't do well? Do they credit others? Are they still learning?

*Authentic:* Honest about limitations. Credits sources and influences. Acknowledges they're still improving.

*Pretentious:* Claims to be the best at everything. Takes credit for others' work. Presents as having arrived.

## Domain-Specific Red Flags

### Food & Restaurants
| Red Flag | What It Signals |
|----------|-----------------|
| Foam, gels, and deconstructed everything | Performance over taste |
| "Farm-to-table" with no farm named | Marketing speak |
| Chef is a celebrity, not in kitchen | The food is secondary |
| Tiny portions with huge prices | You're paying for concept, not food |
| Can't answer where ingredients come from | They don't know or don't care |
| Every item "house-made" | Probably lying |

### Products & Brands
| Red Flag | What It Signals |
|----------|-----------------|
| "Artisanal" with no artisan named | Marketing word, meaningless |
| "Premium" or "luxury" in the name | Insecurity about quality |
| Origin story that sounds too good | Probably fabricated |
| Influencer-heavy marketing | Quality can't speak for itself |
| "Disrupting" anything | Probably just repackaging |
| Complexity where simplicity would work | Hiding something |

### People & Organizations
| Red Flag | What It Signals |
|----------|-----------------|
| Name-drops constantly | Insecure about own merit |
| Won't answer simple questions simply | Hiding ignorance or deception |
| Credits stolen from team members | Character problem |
| Pivots to whatever's trendy | No core conviction |
| Defensive about criticism | Knows it's unearned |
| More followers than substance | Built on performance |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Bullshit Assessment: [Subject]

### Claims Made
[What does it claim to be?]

### Evidence Observed
[What did you actually see, taste, experience?]

### The Five Tests

| Test | Assessment | Evidence |
|------|------------|----------|
| Hands | Authentic/Pretentious | [Who made it, are they visible?] |
| Why | Authentic/Pretentious | [Why does it exist?] |
| Simplicity | Authentic/Pretentious | [Can they explain it clearly?] |
| Consistency | Authentic/Pretentious | [Do they always do this well?] |
| Humility | Authentic/Pretentious | [Do they admit limitations?] |

### Red Flags Identified
- [List any domain-specific red flags]

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "There's a new 'elevated street food' restaurant that's getting a lot of buzz. $85 tasting menu. What do you think?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Bullshit Assessment: Elevated Street Food Concept

### Claims Made
"Taking street food to new heights." "Reimagining humble dishes." "A journey through global street food culture." $85 for a tasting menu of dishes that cost $2 on the streets where they originated.

### Evidence Observed
The menu references Vietnamese banh mi, Mexican tacos, Indian chaat—but the chef has never lived in any of these places. Portions are tiny. Presentation is elaborate. The actual street vendors who perfected these dishes over generations are not credited, consulted, or compensated.

### The Five Tests

| Test | Assessment | Evidence |
|------|------------|----------|
| Hands | Pretentious | The people who invented these dishes are invisible. A chef with no connection to these cultures "elevates" their work. |
| Why | Pretentious | This exists to be impressive and expensive. No one who loves street food asked for this. |
| Simplicity | Pretentious | "Deconstructed banh mi with pork belly foam." The original is perfect. This adds complexity without improving anything. |
| Consistency | Pretentious | Following a trend. Will do something else when "elevated street food" stops being hot. |
| Humility | Pretentious | Claiming to improve food perfected over centuries. No acknowledgment of sources. |

### Red Flags Identified
- "Elevated" and "reimagined" language
- Foam and deconstruction of dishes that don't need it
- Chef has no real connection to source cultures
- Original street vendors not credited
- $85 for food that should cost $8

### The Verdict
**Pretentious**

### The Bourdain Take
"So you're charging $85 for a tasting menu of dishes that the grandmothers who perfected them sell for pocket change? And you've never spent time with those grandmothers? You've never sat on a plastic stool in Saigon or a taco stand in Oaxaca?

The woman who makes pho in Hanoi at 5 AM—she doesn't need you to elevate her work. She IS the work. That bowl of pho, sold for a dollar to factory workers, is already perfect.

What you've made is a costume party. You've taken other people's culture, dressed it up, and sold it to people who want to feel worldly without leaving their comfort zone. That's not food. That's colonialism with better lighting.

Go to the actual street. Eat the actual food. Pay the actual price. That's the elevation you need."
